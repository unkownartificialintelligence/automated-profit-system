## 🤖 METHOD 1: AI Image Generation

### Using DALL-E (OpenAI)

**Cost:** $15/month for ChatGPT Plus

**Step-by-step:**

1. Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Access DALL-E 3 in ChatGPT
3. Use this prompt template:

```
Create a professional t-shirt design with the following specifications:

Main Text: [Your keyword in caps, e.g., "DOG MOM"]
Subtitle: [From automation, e.g., "PROUD MEMBER"]
Style: [From automation, e.g., "playful with paw prints"]
Colors: [Primary and secondary from automation]
Elements: [paw prints, hearts, etc.]

Requirements:
- High contrast for printing
- Professional typography
- Transparent or white background
- Print-ready quality
- 4500 x 5400 pixels minimum
```

4. Generate 4 variations
5. Download the best one
6. Upscale to 4500x5400 using [upscale.media](https://upscale.media)

**Example for "Dog Mom":**
```
Create a professional t-shirt design:

Main text: "DOG MOM" (split across two lines)
Subtitle: "PROUD MEMBER"
Style: Playful with rounded elements and paw prints
Colors: Coral pink (#FF6B6B), turquoise (#4ECDC4), white
Elements: Add cute paw prints and heart shapes

```

### Using Midjourney (Discord)

**Cost:** $10/month

**Step-by-step:**

1. Join [Midjourney Discord](https://discord.gg/midjourney)
2. Subscribe at midjourney.com/account
3. Use the prompt from your automation output
4. Example command:

```
/imagine t-shirt design, dog mom, playful with rounded elements and paw prints, bold typography, vector art, transparent background --ar 3:4 --v 6 --style raw
```

5. Generate variations (U1, U2, U3, U4)
6. Upscale your favorite
7. Download and resize to 4500x5400

**Pro tip:** Use `--v 6` for latest version, `--style raw` for less stylized output

## 🎯 Design Best Practices

### Typography Rules:

1. **Readability First**
   - Test at thumbnail size (can you read it?)
   - Avoid script fonts for main text
   - Use maximum 2-3 fonts

2. **Contrast is King**
   - Dark text on light shirts
   - Light text on dark shirts
   - High contrast = better sales

3. **Size Matters**
   - Main text: 300-600 pts
   - Subtitle: 100-200 pts
   - Leave breathing room

### Color Psychology:

- **Pets:** Warm colors (coral, pink, orange) = love/playful
- **Lifestyle:** Muted pastels = calm/aesthetic
- **Funny:** Bright, bold = energy/humor
- **Holiday:** Red/green/gold = festive
- **Fitness:** Black/red = power/energy

### Layout Tips:

1. **Rule of Thirds**
   - Divide design into 3 sections
   - Place key elements at intersections

2. **White Space**
   - Don't fill every inch
   - Let design breathe
   - 20-30% white space is good

3. **Balance**
   - Symmetrical = professional
   - Asymmetrical = modern/dynamic
   - Choose one approach

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

❌ Using copyrighted images (Disney, logos, etc.)
❌ Too much text (keep it simple!)
❌ Low resolution (minimum 300 DPI)
❌ Cluttered design (less is more)
❌ Poor color contrast
❌ Illegible fonts
❌ Off-center alignment

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"My design looks pixelated"**
- Increase resolution to 300 DPI
- Use 4500x5400 pixel dimensions
- Don't resize small images up

**"Text is hard to read"**
- Increase font size
- Use bolder fonts
- Add stroke/outline
- Improve contrast

**"Canva won't let me download transparent"**
- Need Canva Pro for transparent backgrounds
- Alternative: Use remove.bg to remove background
- Or download with white background and specify in Printful

**"AI generated weird text"**
- Don't rely on AI for text rendering
- Generate design without text
- Add text in Canva on top of AI image

**"I'm not creative"**
- Use templates! Search "t-shirt design" on Canva
- Hire a designer on Fiverr ($10)
- Copy successful designs (don't plagiarize, get inspired)
