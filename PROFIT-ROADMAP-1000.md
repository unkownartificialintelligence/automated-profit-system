## 🎯 The Math: How We Get to $1,000 Profit

### Profit Per Product:
```
Sale Price:        $24.99
Printful Cost:     $12.95
Platform Fees:     $1.62 (6.5%)
Transaction Fee:   $0.87 (3.5%)
Ad Cost (avg):     $1.50
----------------------------
PROFIT PER SALE:   $8.05

To reach $1,000 profit:
$1,000 ÷ $8.05 = 124 sales needed
```

### 60-Day Breakdown:
- **Week 1-2:** 15 sales = $120 profit (organic, friends/family)
- **Week 3-4:** 25 sales = $201 profit (organic + small ads)
- **Week 5-6:** 35 sales = $282 profit (scaling ads)
- **Week 7-8:** 49 sales = $394 profit (optimized campaigns)
